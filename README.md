##Real-Time Character Counter

This project is a simple web application that features a text area where users can type a message, along with a real-time character counter. The counter dynamically updates as the user types, displaying both the number of characters typed and the remaining characters allowed. The application also prevents further typing once the character limit is reached and provides a warning message.

##Features:

Text Area: A user input area with a 200-character limit.
Real-Time Character Counter: Updates in real time as the user types, showing how many characters have been typed and how many are remaining.
Character Limit Handling: Prevents typing once the maximum limit is reached.
Warning Message: Displays a warning when the user reaches the character limit.

##Technologies Used:

HTML: For structuring the text area and messages.
CSS: For styling the text area, counter, and warning message.
JavaScript: For implementing real-time character counting and character limit enforcement.
